For writing and style guidelines we follow the best practices for Github Docs outlined here https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/writing-for-github-docs/best-practices-for-github-docs.

## Purpose

This documentation aims to:
* provide detailed information about the structure of the software
* guidance on deployment
* detailed description of features
* guidance on configuration

## Audience

These documents are written for developers and site-administrators. These documents are desgined to include technical details that will be understood by people with previous programming and DevOps experience. 

To contribute or read information aimed at a non-technical audience please see our (user-documentation)[https://github.com/SciCatProject/user-documentation].

## Out of Scope 
The documentation describes the features of the frontend and backend of the SciCat software at a technical level. User facing documentation is outside the scope of this documentation and should be submitted to: (user-documentation)[https://github.com/SciCatProject/user-documentation]

Site specific documentation should not be included here, unless it is generalised as an example.
