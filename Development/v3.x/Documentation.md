# Documentation

## Overview
The documentation consists of three main parts.

* The "Home Webpage" of the project , describing the purpose and use cases for the software. The source is located at https://github.com/SciCatProject/scicatproject.github.io
* The documentation proper, split into User,Operator,Ingestor and Developer manual. The source is located at https://github.com/SciCatProject/documentation .  It covers all components of the software, i.e  frontend and backend. The documentation tool [honkit](https://honkit.netlify.app/) (successor of gitbook) is used.
* The documentation of the REST API of the backend. This is generated from the swagger.json file, which itself is generated from the model descriptions in loopback


All parts are hosted on the [GitHub Pages platform](https://pages.github.com/). The documentation part is "injected" into the GitHub pages automatically by a travis job, which runs after each commit to the documentation repository

The live web site is then visible on the following URLs respectively
* https://scicatproject.github.io/
* https://scicatproject.github.io/documentation
* https://scicatproject.github.io/api

## Changes and Deployment of Home Webpage

```
git clone https://github.com/SciCatProject/scicatproject.github.io`
cd scicatproject.github.io

# make your changes on index.html directly, then git add and git commit as usual

git push origin master
```

After pushing the changes they will immediately become visible at the URL https://scicatproject.github.io/

## Changes and Deployment of Manuals

```
git clone https://github.com/SciCatProject/documentation.git`
cd documentation

# make your edit/add/commit cycle

npm install honkit --save
npx honkit build
```

### Serving the Documentation locally

`npx honkit serve --port 4040`

### Publishing the documentation

`git push origin master`

The push to the origin repo will trigger a travis job, which will publish the resulting documentation to https://scicatproject.github.io/documentation

## Changes and Deployment of API Documentation

Use the following command to regenerate  the API with an up-to-date swagger.json file

```
    # to install redoc-cli:
    # sudo npm install -g redoc-cli

    # to get an updated swagger.json file
    # wget https://YOUR-API-SERVER/explorer/swagger.json

    redoc-cli bundle -o index.html swagger.json

    # the make commit which replaces the index.html file at
    # https://github.com/SciCatProject/scicatproject.github.io/tree/master/api
```
