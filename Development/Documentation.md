# Documentation

## Overview
The documentation consists of three main parts.

* The "Home Webgpage" of the project , describing the purpose and use cases for the software. The source is located at https://github.com/SciCatProject/scicatproject.github.io 
* The documentation proper, split into User,Operator,Ingestor and Developer manual. The source is located at https://github.com/SciCatProject/documentation .  It covers all components of the software, i.e  frontend and backend. The documentation tool [honkit](https://honkit.netlify.app/) (successor of gitbook) is used.
* The documentation of the REST API of catamel. This is generated from the swagger.json file, which itself is generated from the model descriptions in loopback


All parts are hosted on the [GitHub Pages platform](https://pages.github.com/). The documentation part is "injected" into the GitHub pages automatically by a travis job, which runs after each commit to the documentation repository

The live web site is then visible on the following URLs respectively
* https://scicatproject.github.io/
* https://scicatproject.github.io/documentation
* https://scicatproject.github.io/api
