# Documentation

## Overview
The documentation consists of three main parts.

* The "Home Webgpage" of the project , describing the purpose and use cases for the software. The source is located at https://github.com/SciCatProject/scicatproject.github.io
* The documentation proper, split into User,Operator,Ingestor and Developer manual. The source is located at https://github.com/SciCatProject/documentation . It covers all components of the software, i.e  frontend and backend. The documentation tool [honkit](https://honkit.netlify.app/) (successor of gitbook) is used.
* The documentation of the REST API of the backend. This is generated from the OpenAPI description, which itself is generated from the model descriptions in the backend code.

All parts are hosted on the [GitHub Pages platform](https://pages.github.com/). The documentation part is "injected" into the GitHub pages automatically by a travis job, which runs after each commit to the documentation repository

The live web site is then visible on the following URLs respectively
* https://scicatproject.github.io/
* https://scicatproject.github.io/documentation
* The REST API not generated statically but is available from each running SciCat
  backend (for example, the public [ESS instance](https://scicat.ess.eu/explorer)).
