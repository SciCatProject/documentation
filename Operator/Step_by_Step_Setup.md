# Step by Step manual to Setup SciCat without Containers

## Setup Backend (catamel)

### Mongo

The first part is to setup a Mongo DB, if not yet existing. You will need at least version 3.4 . In the simplest case a simple
```
yum install mongodb-server
```
(on RedHat systems) or similar will suffice.

A production ready setup however may require to setup a replicated DB server. Follow the Mongo DB Manuals in this case. E.g. at PSI we operate a 3 fold relicated Mongo DB server.


#### Hint to add full text indexing

Mongo DB needs to work with Indices to speed up the queries. All of these index definitions are created automatically, with one exception. This exception is described here: the following command must be executed **after** the database has been created in MongoDB, i.e. after starting catamel once.

Log into mongodb at the console, e.g. run 


1. If not using Kubernetes
```
mongo dacat
```

or, if using Kubernetes

```
kubectl exec -it <mongo container> mongo dacat
```
and enter

```javascript
db.Dataset.createIndex( { "$**": "text" } )
```

Note: If the index is not created as above, catanie e2e test fails.

### API Server

#### Prerequisites

First you need to have node/npm installed

```
npm version 6 or higher
Node version 10 or higher
```
The needed database will be created automatically when the API server starts. 

#### Get code
```
git clone https://github.com/SciCatProject/catamel.git
cd catamel
git checkout master # (or develop)
npm install
```

Please note: the master branch is often quite behind the development, therefore to get all new features you may want to use the develop branch instead.

#### Setup configuration
 
There are 5 configuration files that need to be adjusted to your situation. There are example configuration files for each of the 4 configuration files inside the server directory

1. `functionalAccounts.json` : defines the functional accounts, such as admin, ingestor etc
2. `datasources.json` : defines the connection to the Mongo DB -sample datasources.json
3. `providers.json` : defines the authentication source for user accounts, e.g. how to link to your local LDAP/AD server
4. `config.local.js` : defines the API server details, API root address, your local site name and policy settings for , the PID prefix for your datasets, the type of message broker to use, the connection to an email send server etc
5. `component-config.json`: defines the Express framework components, in particular if the *explorer* is enabled and optionally definition of the RabbitMQ topology, if used.

Adjusting these settings to your infrastructure should be straight forward. In case you do not understand a setting just leave it at its default.

##### Email Notifications

When jobs have been submitted successfully, the `node-mailer` package can send an email to the user that initiated.
The details are loaded into `server/config.local.js` and the following block provides an example:

```
smtpSettings: {
      host: 'HOSTPATH',
      port: 587,
      secure: false,
      auth: {user: DOMAIN\\USER', pass: 'PWD'}
    },
    smtpMessage: {
      from: 'gac-dacats@psi.ch',
      to: undefined,
      subject: '[SciCat]',
      text: undefined // can also set html key and this will override this
    }
```

#### Start metadata server
```
npm run start
```

#### Test functionality

```
npm run test
```

You can in addition test the API server using the "explorer", e.g if you run the instance locally point your browser to https://localhost:3000/explorer (note the explorer might be disabled for production environments, check the `component-config.json` file)

![API Explorer](img/explorer.png)

You can use this web interface to test all the available API end points. If you test endpoints, which are protected by authentication, then you first need to login , get an accessToken and fill it into the accessToken field on top of the explorer web page

## Setup GUI frontend
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Angular v8 or higher
npm version 6 or higher
node version 10 or higher
```

### Installing

Use git to clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/SciCatProject/catanie
cd catanie
```
First install the required modules
```
npm install
```
Then build with the Angular CLI
```
npx ng build
```

You can deploy a test server with the following command:

```
npx ng serve 
```


## Running the unit tests

To run the unit tests, type:
```
npm test
```


### End to end tests

To run the end to end tests, type:

```
npm run e2e
```

### Configuration

You can fine tune the features that you want to use in the GUI by setting the flags inside the `src/environments` folder. In this folder you find several example configuraion files used by the Sites. Please adjust to your needs. The `angular.json` file contains a section "configurations" which defines a set of prepared configurations, that you can choose from. This defines which files will be picked up at build time. The build system defaults to the `environment.ts`, but if you e.g. do `ng build --env=development` then `environment.development.ts` will be used instead. Here is an [example configuration file](https://github.com/SciCatProject/catanie/blob/develop/src/environments/environment.development.ts)

The most important configuration setting is the connection to the API server
```
lbBaseURL: "https://your-loopbak-api-server",
```

Many of the other settings are boolean flags, which allow you to switch on/off features of the GUI
Again, if in doubt, just leave the setting as defined in the available example environment files or leave them empty.
