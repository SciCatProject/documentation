# Ingesting Data into SciCat

## Using pyscicat 
Pyscicat is python client for working with the SciCat API, which provides an easy mechanism to ingest data. See  https://www.scicatproject.org/pyscicat/howto/ingest.html to get started. 

For an example of the full workflow, please see the `pyscicat.ipynb` Jupyter notebook in SciCat live: https://github.com/SciCatProject/scicatlive/blob/main/services/jupyter/config/notebooks/pyscicat.ipynb. This includes how to authenticate, create a dataset, add datablocks and upload an attachement.
